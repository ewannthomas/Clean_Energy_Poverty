### Instructions to Replicate Results

- Clone the repository and save the raw data in the same directory.

- The file **"HH"** is the do file for cleaning the panel IHDS datasets.

- Use the file **"HH Final to Sir (on refined data)"** to recreate all the analysis available in the paper.

- The file **"Writeup tabs and graph generate"** includes multiple iterations of the tables and graphs presented in the final paper. Similarly, the file **"Graphs and Spineplots"** includes code for creating some spineplots which were not part of the paper.

- The file **"Individuals"** contains code for cleaning the individuals' datasets of IHDS.
